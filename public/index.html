      MOUNT POINT — React renders into this div. The bundled JS (from index.js
      and its imports) runs, finds this element by id="root", and replaces
      its contents with the React component tree. The HTML file stays minimal;
      all dynamic content comes from React.
    -->
    <div id="root"></div>
    <!--
      The build (npm run build) injects <script> tags for the JS bundle here.
      In development (npm start), the dev server serves the bundle and this
      HTML; the browser loads both and React takes over #root.

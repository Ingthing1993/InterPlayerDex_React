      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

      MOUNT POINT — React renders into this div. The bundled JS (from index.js
      and its imports) runs, finds this element by id="root", and replaces
      its contents with the React component tree. The HTML file stays minimal;
      all dynamic content comes from React.
    -->
    <div id="root"></div>
    <!--
      The build (npm run build) injects <script> tags for the JS bundle here.
      In development (npm start), the dev server serves the bundle and this
      HTML; the browser loads both and React takes over #root.
